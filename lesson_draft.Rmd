title: Tidyverse Lesson Plan
author: Brendan Case
---

The goal of this lesson will be to extend the students' experience
with `dplyr` and `ggplot` to include some of the many other useful
features from the tidyverse package. 

## Topics Covered

The lecture will be roughly split in to 2 main sections of live coding:

1. Overview of packages and functions. This section will introduce the
   packages `purrr`, `stringr`, and `forcats`, and give basic examples
   of some of the cool functions of each.
   
2. Example problems and random hacks. To see some examples of
   start-to-finish R programming within the tidyverse syntax, we will
   work through several data processing and visualization tasks. Along
   the way, we will use some of the functions covered in the previous
   section, and get a sense of the overriding theme of the tidyverse:
   for everything we are used to doing in R, there is a corresponding
   function from the tidyverse which is less silent and more
   consistent. In addition, I will share some useful procedures that
   can be solved with tidyverse functions, such as giving graphs
   complex labels and defining a color palette which maps colors to
   variables across many figures.

## Expected Outcomes

To have a working understanding of the high-level use of each package
in the tidyverse, and a few useful scripts to refer to when coding.

## Assessment

While I do not plan on asking "what should I type next?" type
questions, I will open the class up to discussion about common
frustrations when programming and whether there are particular
questions they would like me to discuss.

## Learning Plan

Students will be expected to come to class able to load the packages `tidyverse` and `wesanderson`.

The students will be encouraged to keep up with the live coding, and
will be referred to several helpful resources for further reading,
exercises, and cheat sheets to keep handy.

## Reflection

Eventual reflection on the following questions:

1. Based on vibe/feedback, how did students feel the content aided
   their understanding of the tidyverse and programming best
   practices?

2. How was the use of time? Did the live coding take longer than
   anticipated?
